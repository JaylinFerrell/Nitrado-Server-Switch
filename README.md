# Nitrado-Server-Switch
Created a website that turned a Nitrado server on and off.  Connected to Nitradoâ€™s API and linked a button to turn on the server and send server notifications to all players without host information. Developed this project using a combination of Typescript, Java Script, HTML and CSS.  Currently working on a feature for other players to turn the server on and off while limiting their access to server controls.
